# Dungeon-Code

"Dungeon Code" will be an interactive game of sorts, inspired heavily by my love of Critical Role and the fantasy and sci-fi genres.

I personally struggle with concentration and staying focused while learning. Hopefully this will be something I can work on to implement what I've learned and cement the knowledge in my brain, while also creating something that will make remembering coding languages a lot easier (and fun).

Dungeon Code will be a set up of fantasy characters, namely a group of 4 including the main character (the user). The focus will be on how each lesson in a language (Python, being as that's the language I learned first) can be implemented as an element in the fantasy. One quick example: spells. For a spellcasting character, they would need components to cast their spell. Let's say "fireball". So the user would need to create a function such as 'def FireballSpell()'. The "player" would need to write the correct code which would create a function that, one, takes in the components of the spell as arguments, and two, applies them in some way. There could be time limits to make things more interesting, and the potential to fail to add stakes to the game. There will be numerous details to flesh out, such as should the spells be created in battle, or pre-battle?. Basic art will need to be added, but the skeleton of the design should take priority.

For each idea, I will create a blog post with details on layout, code, and basic steps on how the "game" should play out the scenario. (Blog link in bio).

Hopefully with time my skills and knowledge will get better and better and I can make something truly epic.
